## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node
- NPM

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
## Framework

The project has been bootstrapped with the React framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

I am a big fan of this framework for a few reasons:
- Zero config to deployment (As a result, here is the deployed version https://sketch-frontend-code-test.vercel.app/)
- Opinionated
- Server side rendering capabilities
